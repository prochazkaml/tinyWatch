Vendored ATDF Files
===================

These atdfs were downloaded from <http://packs.download.atmel.com/> and are kept in here to be converted to *svd* using [atdf2svd](https://github.com/Rahix/atdf2svd) and later to rust using [svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust).

Please keep in mind that the names of these files have to be exactly the same as the names of the rust modules (ie `atmega32u4` instead of `ATmega32U4`).
